            Hello! I&apos;m Mete. I was born in AydÄ±n, Turkey in June 2001.
            Currently, I&apos;m a 2. grade Computer Engineering at Sakarya
            University. I enjoy researching, learning, thinking, and being
            interested in technology. My main domain is front end, however, I am
            interested in backend also.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            Collaboration and continuous learning are essential to me. I enjoy
            working with teams, exchanging ideas, and staying up-to-date with
            the latest industry trends. I am dedicated to delivering
            high-quality code and optimizing performance to create efficient and
            engaging digital products. I would love the opportunity to
            contribute my skills and creativity to your projects. Let&apos;s work
            together to bring your digital experiences to life!
